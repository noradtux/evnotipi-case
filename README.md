# A case for EVnotiPi

Holds Raspberry Pi Zero W and hats like the PiOBD2Hat and the PiCAN. 6 M2.5 screws are needed.
I recommend to print this from PETG. Layer height is not important, if your slicer supports
it I suggest putting supports into the recessed screw holes.

Additional hardware required is:
- an angled USB adapter, like https://www.reichelt.de/usb-2-0-adapter-a-stecker-a-buchse-90-gewinkelt-schwarz-n-ccgp60930bk-p243734.html
- a micro USB OTG adapter
- a male DB9 connector
- an OBD2 to DB9 cable
- Optionally you can install SMA pigtails to cleanly connect external antennas to the LTE adapter
